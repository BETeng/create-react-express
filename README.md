# Create-React-Express Boilerplate

## About This Boilerplate

Build your React app using Node and Express with this boilerplate. This boilerplate comes with many popular libraries such as `redux`, `react-router-dom`, `axios` and many more out of the box!.

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack

```
Frontend

* React
* Redux

Backend

* Node
* Express

```

Full list of dependencies can be found inside `package.json` files.

## ðŸ’» Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following commands:

```
npm install
cd client
npm install
cd ..
```

Once the installation is finished, from the root directory, run the following command to start the app.

``` npm run dev ```

Your app should automatically open on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## ðŸŒŽ Deployment (Heroku)

### Create a Git Repo

Once you're ready to deploy, start by making sure your project is a git repository. If so, proceed to the next section, otherwise run the following commands in your terminal:

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### Heroku

Make sure that you have a Heroku app created for this project. If so, proceed to the next section, otherwise run the following command in your terminal:

```
heroku create
```

Optionally add an argument for your application's name after `create`, e.g.

```
heroku myawesomeapp
```

### Deploying

After confirming that you have an up to date git repository and a Heroku app created, complete the following:

1. Build the React app for production by running the following command:

```
npm run build
```

2. Add and commit all changes to git

```
git add -A
git commit -m "commit message:
```
3. Push to Heroku

```
git push heroku master
```

If all previous steps were followed correctly, your application should be deployed to Heroku!
